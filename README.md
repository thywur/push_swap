# push_swap

This is a sorting algorithm project designed to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort the stack with the minimum number of operations.

## Allowed operations

- `sa`: Swap the first two elements of stack A.
- `sb`: Swap the first two elements of stack B.
- `ss`: Swap the first two elements of both stacks A and B.
- `pa`: Push the top element from stack B to stack A.
- `pb`: Push the top element from stack A to stack B.
- `ra`: Rotate stack A upwards.
- `rb`: Rotate stack B upwards.
- `rr`: Rotate both stacks A and B upwards.
- `rra`: Rotate stack A downwards.
- `rrb`: Rotate stack B downwards.
- `rrr`: Rotate both stacks A and B downwards.
